Task 1-Sensor Read & Print (10 pts)
• Read DHT22 every 5 seconds and print the temperature and humidity with 2
decimals.
• Evidence: serial screenshot.
Task 2-Telegram Send (15 pts)
• Implement send_message() and post a test message to your group.
• Evidence: chat screenshot.
Task 3-Bot Command (15 pts)
• Implement /status to reply with current T/H and relay state.
• Implement /on and /off to control the relay.
• Evidence: chat screenshot showing all three commands working.
Task 4-Bot Command (20 pts)
• No messages while T < 30 °C.
• If T ≥ 30 °C and relay is OFF, send an alert every loop (5 s) until /on is
received.
• After /on, stop alerts. When T < 30 °C, turn relay OFF automatically and send
a one-time “auto-OFF” notice.
• Evidence: short video (60–90s) demonstrating above behavior.
Task 5-Robustness (10 pts)
• Auto-reconnect Wi-Fi when dropped.
• Handle Telegram HTTP errors (print status; skip this cycle on failure).
• Avoid crashing on DHT OSError (skip cycle).
Task 6-Document(30 pts)
• README.md with wiring diagram/photo, configuration steps (token, chat id),
and usage instructions.
• Include a block diagram or flowchart of your loop/state.
